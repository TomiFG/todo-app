# todo-app

#### Built using Python, Flask and vanilla Javascript.
---
In order to run the app in a local server for the first time, execute the _**run.sh**_ file, found in the main directory, with the word "first" as an argument ("./run.sh first"). This will create a virtual environment and install dependencies before running the local server.

To run the server again, for all subsequent times, execute _**run.sh**_ with no arguments.

You will need to have _Python 3.8.3_ (or higher), _pip_ and _virtualenv_ installed.
